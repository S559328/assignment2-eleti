###### My Favorite Sport is Portuguese Football
 Football is my favorite sport because it requires a lot of running and **teaches cooperation and team work**, helps __develop positive social skills__ and teaches respect for others. It helps build __self-confidence, a positive self-image and self-worth__. The friendships amongst a team of football players is unlike any other sport due to the high volume of teammates.
